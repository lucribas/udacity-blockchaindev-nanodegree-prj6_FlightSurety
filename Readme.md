# Course 4 Project: Dapp with Autonomous Smart Contracts and Oracles

In this project, you’ll build a decentralized application for a use case in which you have airlines that offer flight delay insurance, and passengers who carry this insurance, and who get paid in the event their flight is delayed. You’ll build multiple smart contracts which are autonomously triggered by external sources, and which handle payments based on flight delay scenarios.
